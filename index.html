      <br />
      <h2>How to Start Playing</h2>
      <h3>Step 1:</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        First you'll need to download Parsec from the
        <a href="https://parsec.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
          Parsec website.
        </a>
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Parsec will allow you to play games installed on a cloud computer
        through your own local desktop at low latencies and lag, helping you
        play smoothly and at higher frame rates.
        <br />
        <br />

        You can get more info about Parsec from their
        <a
          href="https://parsec.app/features"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
        >
          website.
        </a>
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
      </p>
      <h3>Step 2:</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        Set up your account for Parsec and log in to your account on the desktop
        app. Parsec also has an android app you can download to get started. But
        I'll recommend the desktop app, for now, to, help you easily get
        familiar with the Parsec environment.
        <br />
        At first, after you login, there will be a visible device on the home
        page. This device will be visible to you if you're using a a windows
        machine. But for you to play the games I've installed on the cloud
        you'll need to an invite link to connect to my desktop through the
        homepage.
        <br />
        <br />
        The link is dynamic, meaning you'll have to dm me to connect to my
        current shared session on parsec. Once you dm, I'll send the link for
        you to get started.
      </p>
      <p>
        The link will allow you to now connect to my desktop machine on the
        cloud from your Parsec account and allow to start playing games.
        Caution: If you can't see a desktop machine on your Parsec account, try
        relaunching the app. From there everything is easy, just go select the
        game you'd like to play on playnite, dm to accept it to start playing.
        Some apps however will be pre-accepted so just click on the game and
        start playing.
        <br />
        <br />
        If there's no view of it, please dm or call me through WhatsApp or phone
        my using number - 0796460811.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
        <br />
        Once you see the desktop machine click on it. Wait for a few minutes in
        order for the machine to start up. It will redirect Windows UI where
        you'll see the stream app that you'll use to play the games you'd like.
        <br />
        <br />
        You will need to click on the Stream app and choose the game you'd like
        to play for the list available. There will be no charge for playing the
        games available, however we do desire some feedback on usage so will
        truly be grateful if you could help us out.
        <br />
        <br />
        Sessions however will also run for 2-4hrs per day. This is due to the
        high costs of hosting, so we ask to bare with us as we look to
        increasing and making sessions endlessly.
        <br />
        <br />
      </p>
      <h3>Games available</h3>
      <p>
        There are currenly there are about 50 titles, some already downloaded
        some not. So if you'd like to play games not installed you'll have to
        tell dm. To see full list of titles go to steam, on the virtual pc
        through your parsec account and view the list of titles incase you'd
        like to play more games.
        <br />
        Some popular titles already installed include: Fifa 2021, WarFrame, Need
        For Speed Heat - 2020. It also includes a list of some Indie game titles
        incase you're into that kind of stuff.
